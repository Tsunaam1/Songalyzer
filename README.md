# Songalyzer
Songalyzer is a small project using HTML, CSS, JS and Spotify API. Thanks to Spotify API, it shows certain information about song you choose (for example, it can show the BPM of the song or how popular it is).

# Current state
It is currently WIP. Adjusting the project to Spotify's rules.

# Dependencies
To use Songalyzer, I currently just need your e-mail address of your Spotify account. Yes I know it is kinda sketchy, but I can't put it out yet due to their rules.

# I want to try it!
First of all, I need your e-mail of your Spotify (lol xd). You can send it to me to my Discord: Tsunaam1, or my Instagram: @tsunaami42069.
Then you just simply go to the website and login (Přihlásit se). The site is in Czech so if you need, you can use Google Translator.
