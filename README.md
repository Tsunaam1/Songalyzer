# Songalyzer
Songalyzer is a small project using HTML, CSS, JS and Spotify API. Thanks to Spotify API, it shows certain information about song you choose (for example, it can show the BPM of the song or how popular it is.

# Current state
It is currently WIP. Adjusting the project to Spotify's rules.

# Dependencies
To use Songalyzer, I currently just need your e-mail address of your Spotify account. Yes I know it is kinda sketchy, but I can't put it out yet due to their rules.
