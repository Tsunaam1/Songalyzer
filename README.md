# Songalyzer
Songalyzer is a small project using HTML, CSS, JS and Spotify API.

# Current state
It is currently WIP. Adjusting the project to Spotify's rules.

# Dependencies
To use Songalyzer, I currently just need your e-mail address of your Spotify account. Yes I know it is kinda sketchy, but I can't put it out yet due to their rules.
